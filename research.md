My research is focused on using active and passive seismic methods to study tectonics, volcanism, and hazards. I'm interested in the large-scale processes that shape the Earth, and how these processes affect people.

The Hawaiian-Emperor Seamount Chain is a beautiful type example of a seamount chain, built up through magmatic activity over time as the Pacific plate moved over the Hawaiian hotspot.

Zealandia, located in X, is sometimes called the "Hidden Continent" since over 90% of it is submerged beneath the ocean. In 2017, I sailed on the R/V Kairei as part of a multi-leg campaign to collect active source seismic data, piston cores, and box cores to study this unique continental endmember.
